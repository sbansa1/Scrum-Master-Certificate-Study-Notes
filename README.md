Scrum Master Certificate Study Notes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 
o
In Scrum, one needs to build the base components in first fewSprints. The Architects needs to start a couple of Sprints earlier thanDevelopment team.
o
Its always a good practice to share the knowledge about Agile andScrum to customer. You will need customer’s support to succeed.
o
Scrum is CMM Level 3.-
Some Scrum Terminology:
o
Product backlog(Requirements from the entire release)
o
Sprint Planning(usually happens in Day 1)
o
Sprint backlog (Outcome of Sprint planning)
o
Daily Scrum(Product Owner, team members and Scrum mastershould be a part of Daily Scrum)
o
Sprint Review (demo at the end of Sprint)
o
Sprint Retrospective(Postmortem at the end of Sprint)
o
Product domain expert is usually the Product owner.
o
 Team Velocity is the number of stories created by Team in a Sprint.
o
In Scrum, the Product burn down chart is used to provide a “bigpicture” perspective on the progress of the project. There is one of the very few metrics used to track the project. This chart has “hoursspent” in y-axis and “Sprint days” on x-axis. The progress is plottedon this. The Focus of this chart is on how much time is left and notactually on how much is spent.-
Role of Scrum Master-
o
Usually serve as a Servant Leader.
o
Acts as a Facilitator- Helps make sure that the team is following theScrum properly.
o
Ideally, a Single Scrum Master should not handle more than 3Scrum teams at a time.
o
Scrum Master should be a neutral person, not having any Conflict of Interest.
o
Scrum Master should have a role in setting up the team.
o
Scrum Master is a Influencer, Negotiator and Good at Persuasion.
o
Scrum Master should be accountable for the success of the project.
o
Scrum Masters can or cannot be Technically sound. It is more of aServant Leadership role. More of a Leadership/Management role.-
Scrum Adoption points:
o
Definition of “DONE” should be clarified and understood beforeeven estimating for the Sprint.
o
Before every sprint starts, there is a planning phase. You don’t haveto go into sprint blindly. Sprints need to follow planning.
o
Customer validation should happen throughout the lifecycle and canbe initiated by the team.
o
 Testability is an important aspect in Scrum.
 
o
It is a great practice to question the Customer appropriately tomake sure that they know what they really want. Survey is a goodmeans to get the Information.
o
 The general progress trend is that the team usually falls behindexpectation in the first 2-3 days of Sprint. The idea is to use thatdata as opportunity to improve than punish.
o
Scrum generally helps expose mess. If you are not able to showworking Software at the end of the Sprint, Ask yourself- what issuesare preventing the working Software to be seen (SprintRetrospective). It will help expose Organization’s failures.
o
Scrum is usually introduced as a change to the existing processes.Whenever the change is introduced, it goes through the rounds of resistance. Persistence kills Resistance.
o
 Testing is an integral part of Scrum. Adoption of automation is goodbut not mandatory. Unless there are business benefits, adoption of automation not necessary.
o
Estimations are just that- “Estimations” usually never accurate.Generally the term “Sizing” is used as against Estimations. Somerelevant techniques such as “Planning Poker”(http://www.planningpoker.com), Three point estimation, “Muscow”model etc. helps come with an accurate sort of sizing and valueestimation.
o
Usually not recommended to have different Sprint durations in therelease. If one Sprint is 1 month, it is considered as viable to haveother Sprints also be 1 month.
o
 The term- Backlog Grooming means that team spending 5 to 10% of time in planning for the next Sprint.-
Requirements handling in Scrum:
o
User Stories are generally a workable unit of requirement.
o
Each User Story has multiple Story points, which takes therequirement to even more granular unit.
o
Each Story point further has more Acceptance criterias, whichshould be met for the Sprint to pass.
o
 The Focus while coming up with the requirements is on WHAT andWHY. General tendency for the people in the team is to start mixingWHAT with HOW, which is not a good practice.
o
Acceptance criteria should not be too long. If it is getting too long,ask your product owner to Split the User Story further.
o
User Story should cover WHO, WHAT and WHY of the requirement.
o
Acceptance Criteria is usually created by Product owners. If forsome reason, Product owner does not create Acceptance criteria, hemust be involved to Approve and Sign-off the existing criteria.-
DONE in Scrum:

 
o
 The definition of “DONE” should be agreed up by all the teammembers and Scrum Master and the Product Owner. The “DONE”criteria should be granular and should be interpreted properly andaccurately by all the team members.
o
 Traceability can be one of the important “DONE” criteria, whichmeans Traceability of implemented code to Design document andfurther down to Requirements level.
o
Set “DONE” bar as realistic as possible. If its unrealistic, thenmorale of the team goes down.
o
All Scrum teams in a project should ideally have the same definitionof “DONE”.-
Agile in Offshore teams-
o
 Though not preferred but possible as long as regular Face-to-Faceinteraction can be managed.
o
Communication and proper facilitation of communication necessaryfor Agile to be successful in Offshore teams.-
Daily Scrum meetings-
o
Focus of these meetings is only on Whats done the last day, thePlan for today and Impediments to the project.
